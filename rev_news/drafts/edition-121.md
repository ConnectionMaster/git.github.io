## Developer Spotlight: Peter Krefting

* **Who are you and what do you do?**

  My name is Peter Krefting and I am a software engineer. Hailing from Sweden,
  I moved to Norway for my first job, at Opera Software, mostly working on
  internals such as Unicode support and internal libraries. I ended up staying
  in Norway and am currently working for a small company providing monitoring
  equipment for digital TV.

* **What are you doing on the Git project these days, and why?**

  My answer to these two are the same, I am the maintainer of the
  [Swedish translation of Git](https://github.com/git-l10n/git-po/blob/master/po/sv.po).
  I like having software running in my own language, and sometimes
  you have to take matters in your own hands.

* **If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?**

  I think [`git gui`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-gui) and
  [gitk](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk) could need some extra love,
  these are my daily drivers, in addition to the command line.

* **Is there something that developers could do to ease the life of
  translators?**

  My main gripe is using library function names as verbs,
  like "cannot fsync". That's hard to read even in the original
  language, even for a C developer like myself.

* **What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of
  Git itself?**

  I like simple and clean interfaces, so using [cgit](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Cgit)
  to visualize history on a web server is very nice.

* **What is your toolbox for interacting with the mailing list and for
  development of Git?**

  I mostly just read the mailing list, and only a small percentage of the
  posts to it; the localization is handled through [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/git-l10n/git-po/pulls?q=is%3Apr),
  so that's where that work happens. The few patches I have sent to the
  mailing list have been very manual, using `git format-patch` and
  the [Alpine mail client](https://alpineapp.email/).

* **What is your advice for people who want to start Git development?
  Where and how should they start?**

  Find some small part you want to improve, and work on that. Git is a
  fairly complex piece of software, implemented in several different
  languages, making it hard to get an overview. I most definitely do not,
  even if I have read (and translated) most of the user-visible strings.

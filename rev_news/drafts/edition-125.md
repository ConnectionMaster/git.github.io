* 20 years ago: [Meet the new maintainer..](https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.58.0507262004320.3227@g5.osdl.org/)

  On July 26 Jul 2005, so 20 years ago, Linus Torvalds announced on
  the mailing list that Junio Hamano accepted the maintainership of
  the Git project and that Junio "was the obvious choice". Linus said
  he wasn't dropping Git but he just prefered working on it as a
  contributor.

  Junio replied with an [A note from the new GIT maintainer](https://lore.kernel.org/git/7vmzo8ss2l.fsf@assigned-by-dhcp.cox.net/)
  email where he acknowledged his new role as Git maintainer, thanked
  the community for their support and collaboration, and promised to
  take a more careful and deliberate approach in shepherding the
  project. He also said he would post his own patches to the mailing
  list for review before including them in the repository, and
  encouraged community feedback.

* [[ANNOUNCE] Git Mini Summit at Open Source Summit Europe, Amsterdam, August 28th](https://lore.kernel.org/git/aGwHt9HCd86hVuKh@pks.im/)

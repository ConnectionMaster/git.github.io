## Community Spotlight: Chris Torek

_[Chris Torek](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1256452/torek) has been a prolific
contributor to the Git topic on Stack Overflow. This edition features an interview
with him. This a continuation of our initiative to interview community contributors
ouitside of our mailing list. Our first interview was [with VonC in edition 106](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2023/12/31/edition-106/#community-spotlight-vonc)_.


* **Who are you and what do you do?**

  "Who am I" is way too complicated! ðŸ™‚ What I do ... well, I'm now
  retired, and you'd think that would give me more time to answer things
  like this.

  I used to do a lot of embedded systems programming, and a lot of
  internal company education at times (about programming languages,
  various hardware functions and limitations, software tools, and such).
  That's what led me to [answering StackOverflow questions](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1256452/torek?tab=summary).

* **What would you name your most important contribution to Git?**

  I haven't put much into Git itself. I fixed a minor issue with
  case-insensitive rename once, and something that was annoying me about
  `git diff` applied to merge commits [[ref](https://public-inbox.org/git/pull.804.v4.git.git.1591978801.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)].

* **What was your motivation behind answering questions about Git on
  Stack Overflow?**

  Here, well, I got roped into explaining Git to a group that was moving
  from Mercurial. I found existing descriptions to be lacking.
  Eventually that particular job went away but the question-answering
  persisted, until I got sufficiently annoyed at StackOverflow itself
  (for various reasons) to take a break that continues to this day.

* **If you could get a team of expert developers to work full time on
  something in Git for a full year, what would it be?**

  I'm not entirely sure.  There are a few big issues today, such as
  dealing with OS irregularities (the fact that Windows can't name a
  file `aux.h` for instance is a trivial example of the overall problem;
  very long file names, case and UTF-8 encoding sensitivities are
  another example of the same underlying issue); the ongoing
  [transition from SHA-1 to SHA-256](https://git-scm.com/docs/hash-function-transition)
  (which works now but there's no cross-compatibility); a number
  of minor but sometimes important niggles with merging; support
  for extremely large code bases, including submodules and other
  ideas (Microsoft's Git VFS). I have no ideas for *how* to
  achieve this but a better way to "see" history would,
  I think, be a huge improvement.

  One other thing that might be particularly good is an equivalent of
  [Mercurial's `evolve` extension](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/doc/evolution/).
  But even Mercurial's was never mainstreamed; this is very hard to
  get right (whatever "right" means).

* **If you could remove something from Git without worrying about backwards
  compatibility, what would it be?**

  I'm not convinced anything needs to be _removed_, but it would
  simplify things a lot if we didn't need SHA-1 compatibility, if
  SHA-256 magically just worked and everything were converted over. (And
  looking at [VonC's reply](https://git.github.io/rev_news/2023/12/31/edition-106/#community-spotlight-vonc)
  I agree that `switch`+`restore` is a much better
  split than the old `checkout`.) And, although people like it for
  convenience, it might be OK if we all had to use separate
  `fetch`-then-(whatever is needed) steps: see below.

* **What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git itself?**

  I don't think I have one. I've used [gitk](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitk)
  for history browsing, and if it were somehow improved (see the list of
  items above) it might be particularly useful.

* **What is one of your most favourite features of Git?**

  Speed. Having used the previous generations of version control (and
  waited, and waited...), there's nothing quite like doing an update and
  having it take only seconds. The distributed nature is also pretty
  crucial, though it has its pluses and minuses.

* **Could you brief a bit about one of your most memorable experience with Git?**

  Hah, the most memorable one was probably one of the worst, back in the
  days of Git 1.5 or so. Back then, an initial `git pull` wasn't always
  careful about a pre-populated working tree. I had it destroy a week's
  worth of code once. Ever since then I've separated pull into fetch
  followed by merge-or-rebase. This is long since fixed, but it's
  instructive to new users to know that `pull` is really two separate
  steps. When I started, I didn't know that: the tutorial I read just
  said to run `git pull`.

* **What is your advice for people who want to start using Git? Where
  and how should they start?**

  I'm not entirely fond of any of the introductions I've seen. I started
  on a book once (between jobs) but stalled out when I went to work for
  another startup. One of these days I plan to get back to it.

* **There's a common conception that "Git is confusing". What are your
  thoughts about the same?**

  There *are* confusing parts, but they are inherent to the issues that
  occur with distributed repositories and independent development. The
  only way to really understand this is to get a good groundingâ€”hence
  the idea of writing a book.

* **If thereâ€™s one tip you would like to share with other Git
  developers, what would it be?**

  For *developers* in particular, they should probably have a look at
  what surprises Git users. If something didn't work the way someone
  expected it to, why? Was it an incorrect expectation (it probably was)
  and if so, why did the user *have* that expectation in the first
  place?

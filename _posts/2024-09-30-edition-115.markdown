### Reviews

* [[PATCH] tests: drop use of 'tee' that hides exit status](https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq4j7uhfvm.fsf@gitster.g/)

  Junio Hamano, the Git maintainer, sent a patch removing uses of the
  `tee` command from test scripts.
  [tee(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(command)) is a shell
  command that duplicates its input to both its output and to one or
  more files. The issue was that in some test scripts it was used
  after a [pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) to
  directly duplicate the output of a Git command, so using a format
  like:

  `git COMMAND OPTIONS... | tee FILE...`

  However, it's not a good idea to use a pipe after a Git command because
  pipes discard the exit code of the command before them, so the
  standard (Unix) shell behaviour is that the exit code of the whole
  sequence is simply the exit code of the last command of a pipe sequence,
  here `tee`. In Git tests though, we wouldn't want a test
  to pass if the Git command fails when it should succeed.

  \[For shell intimates: there are ways to override this default behaviour,
  such as [the `pipefail` option](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_19_09_02),
  or [named pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe), but
  there are a number of reasons, like shell portability and making
  it easy to understand small parts of the code, why Git developers
  try to avoid using those features in the Git codebase.\]

  As there was no reason to hide the exit code of the Git commands in
  the tests that used `tee`, Junio's patch basically just replaced
  `| tee` with a simple `>`
  [redirection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redirection_(computing)).

  Rubén Justo replied to Junio suggesting a wording improvement in the
  commit message, but otherwise agreeing with the patch.

  Johannes Schindelin, alias Dscho, also replied to Junio saying that
  having something that duplicates the output of the Git command to
  standard output could still be useful for debugging, especially when
  dealing with CI failures. He showed an implementation of a
  `redirect_and_show()` helper function that could perhaps be used
  instead of `tee`, but agreed that it might be overkill and hoped that
  having more unit tests written in C could help.

  Jeff King, alias Peff, replied to Dscho saying that a better help
  for debugging CI failures might be to have a way to automatically
  save the state of the test directory, called
  `trash directory.tXXXX-YYYY` where `tXXXX-YYYY` is related to the
  name of the test script.

  Junio also replied to Dscho saying that a simple `cat FILE`
  instruction could be added after the lines where `| tee` was
  replaced with a redirection to make sure the Git command output
  appeared on standard output. Junio also agreed with Peff that saving
  the state of test directories would be best to debug CI failures.

  A version of Junio's patch taking into account the wording
  improvement suggested by Rubén was eventually merged.

### Support
-->

## Developer Spotlight: Jialuo She

_Editor's note: We're starting a new initiative in Git Rev News where
 we interview recent GSoC/Outreachy students to get their reflections
 on completing their projects. Feel free to share any thoughts or
 feedback you might have!_

* Who are you and what do you do?

  My name is Jialuo She. I find it quite challenging to select an English
  name for myself, so I decide to leave it as is. However, you can simply
  call me "Luo(/lwɔː/)". I am currently employed at NVIDIA as a Tegra
  System Architect. In this role, I am responsible for developing the
  verification infrastructure for complex full-chip features, such as
  CPU-GPU cache coherency. So my daily job is unrelated to Git. In my
  spare time, I continue my GSoC work to
  [implement consistency checks for refs](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/ukm4PTEF).

* How did you initially become interested in contributing to Git,
  and what motivated you to choose it as your GSoC project?

  When I was a student, I read [the book "Pro Git"](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
  to learn how to use Git in my daily development process. One day, I
  found [a tutorial](https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/) that teaches
  how to write a mini Git step by step, and I really appreciated the
  design of Git.

  As I was approaching my graduate school graduation, I hoped to use the
  opportunity provided by GSoC to do something meaningful for the long
  term. Since I felt that I had an understanding of Git's internal
  principles, believing that my chances of being selected would be much
  higher. When I saw the "Implement consistency check for refs" project,
  I became very interested and resolutely chose Git.

* How do you balance your contributions with other responsibilities
  like work or school?

  As a newcomer, contributing to Git can be particularly time-consuming
  due to unfamiliarity with the overall codebase. I would dedicate an
  evening to responding to review feedback, which forces me to think
  about how to make improvements, and then I would code over the weekend.
  Of course, if there were urgent situations at work or life, I would have
  to postpone my contributions to Git. I feel there's no need to think
  about balancing because it happens naturally.

* What was your biggest takeaway or learning from GSoC that you now
  apply regularly in your work?

  After participating in GSoC, I begin to consider whether my commit
  sequence is clear and understandable when writing code at work. I also
  become more stringent with myself regarding commit messages, ensuring
  they clearly explain the background, motivation, and implementation
  details.

* What was the biggest challenge you faced during your contributions
  to Git, and how did you overcome it?

  When building the ref consistency check infrastructure, I encountered
  an exceptionally long review process that lasted about three months.
  It was quite frustrating because there was no positive feedback compared
  with other participants. Then I reflected on myself, wondering why I
  was always comparing myself to others instead of focusing on what I was
  doing. So, I adjusted my mindset.

* Have you thought about mentoring new GSoC students?

  If I have the opportunity and time, I would definitely mentor GSoC
  students. I am very grateful to my mentors, Patrick and Karthik, for
  introducing me to the Git community and enabling me to continue
  contributing after completing GSoC. I hope that one day I can also
  ignite the passion in others.

* If you could remove something from Git without worrying about
  backwards compatibility, what would it be?

  The write and read support for symlink symrefs.

* What is your favorite Git-related tool/library, outside of Git
  itself?

  I very much like the [GitLens tool](https://gitlens.amod.io/) when using
  VSCode. By using this tool, I hardly use the bare `git blame` command.

* What is your toolbox for interacting with the mailing list and for
  development of Git?

  When reviewing patches, I will firstly use [`b4`](https://b4.docs.kernel.org/en/latest/)
  or simply fetch the branch stored in Junio's tree, and then I will
  see the diffs just in the VSCode. To reply to a patch, I download the
  raw email and use [`mutt`](http://www.mutt.org/) to write contents.
  When sending patches, I still use `mutt` to make the environment as
  simple as possible to improve efficiency.

  I develop Git using VSCode and the [clangd](https://clangd.llvm.org/)
  language server. I generate the `compile_commands.json` file using
  `compiledb make`. I believe this is one of the best development
  approaches available today, offering excellent code suggestions,
  completions, and static analysis.

* How do you envision your own involvement with Git or other open
  source projects in the future?

  I hope to complete the implementation of all ref consistency checks.
  Additionally, I aim to further familiarize myself with the Git codebase
  related to refs, follow the development of the reftable backend, and
  participate in more reviews.

* What is your advice for people who want to start Git development?
  Where and how should they start?

  In my opinion, the barrier to starting contributions to Git is relatively
  high because Git doesn't have something like "good first issue" labels.
  Therefore, I believe the best approach is to participate in mentoring
  programs or continue work from certain mentoring programs as a student.

* Would you recommend other students or contributors to participate in
  the GSoC, or other mentoring programs, working on Git? Why? Do you
  have advice for them?

  I highly recommend that students integrate into the Git community
  through mentoring programs. These programs provide basic ideas to help you
  get started and contribute to Git. Working on Git is an amazing experience,
  allowing you to be guided by many experienced contributors, improve your
  code quality standards, and enhance your communication skills.

  As for advice to participants, I believe the most important thing is not to
  think of the project merely as a resume booster. Instead, let your passion
  shine through and stay at the community after mentoring programs.
